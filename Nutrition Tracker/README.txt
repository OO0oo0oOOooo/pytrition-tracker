1. Press Create File to generate a new directory and txt file for that year-month-day if one doesn't exist.
2. Enter amount of C: P: F: for each food "C:100" "P:1" "F:1"
3. Close txt file. (Using Calc Nutrition with txt file open doesnt adds incorrectly)
4. Press Calc Nutrition to add all food items "C:number" to total.

Edit Template.txt to control how new files will generate. (Not recomended)

This is just a quick solution to save me from writing and adding everything up.
